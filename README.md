# JUnit Pioneer Demo

A simple project that demonstrates how to configure Maven and Gradle to pull in JUnit Pioneer for tests.
See [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) and [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts), respectively.
Both build configurations also show how to include a JSON parser for use with the JSON sources for parameterized tests.

For guides on how to use JUnit Pioneer's features, check [the documentation](https://junit-pioneer.org/docs/).
